# Mutual-Fund-Investment-Analysis-Using-Python
## 🔍 Key Insights
### Monte Carlo simulation was used to model multiple possible future outcomes of a mutual fund investment, helping to understand uncertainty in returns.

### The simulation results show a distribution of portfolio values, indicating that investment returns are not fixed and vary across different scenarios.

### The histogram highlights that most outcomes are clustered around the average portfolio value, suggesting a stable expected return over the long term.

### The mean (average) portfolio growth line provides a clear reference point for the expected investment outcome.

### A small number of simulations show higher or lower extreme values, reflecting real-world market volatility and risk.

### Visualizing the results makes it easier to compare risk vs return rather than relying on a single projected value.

## 📌 Conclusions
### Monte Carlo simulation is an effective method for forecasting investment performance and understanding possible future risks.

### The project demonstrates how Python can be used for basic financial analysis and decision support.

### Rather than predicting a single outcome, the simulation provides a range of possible portfolio values, which is more realistic for financial planning.

### This analysis helps investors set better expectations about returns and understand potential fluctuations in the market.

### Overall, the project shows a beginner-level yet practical application of Python in finance and data analysis.
