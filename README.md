## 🔍 Key Insights
### Monte Carlo simulation was used to model multiple possible future outcomes of a mutual fund investment, helping to understand uncertainty in returns.

### The simulation results show a distribution of portfolio values, indicating that investment returns are not fixed and vary across different scenarios.

### The histogram highlights that most outcomes are clustered around the average portfolio value, suggesting a stable expected return over the long term.

### The mean (average) portfolio growth line provides a clear reference point for the expected investment outcome.

### A small number of simulations show higher or lower extreme values, reflecting real-world market volatility and risk.

### Visualizing the results makes it easier to compare risk vs return rather than relying on a single projected value.
